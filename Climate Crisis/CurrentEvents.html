      <p>The intensifying climate crisis has become very clear with the frequent reports of extreme weather in 2021, from heatwaves and hurricanes in the US to deadly flooding in Europe and China.  According to the UN, climate and weather related disasters surge have five-folded over the past 50 years disproportionally impacting poorer countries. We need to remember that the climate emergency is not just destroying our planet but exacerbating the systematic inequality in our society. </p>
