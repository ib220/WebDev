          <h1>Human's role in climate crisis is 'unequivocal'</h1>
          <p> Recent studies have shown that the Siberian heat wave in 2020 and extreme heat across Asia in 2016 would never have happened without humans burning fossil fuels. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mySlides">
          <h1>We are set to pass 1.5C warming by 2040</h1>
          <p>So far the report says, humans have caused the world to heat up by around 1.1C since the period 1850-1900.   The best-case scenarios the report explored would stabilize warming at 1.5 degrees, but that would involve cutting emissions to “net-zero” by 2050. Immediate, rapid and large-scale cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are needed to keep these climate goals within our grasp.</p>
        </div>
       
        <div class="mySlides">
          <h1>We are not doing enough</h1>
           <p>Currently, countries are falling short of what is needed to avoid the worst effects of climate change, according to a U.N. analysis from earlier this year. Even if current emissions pledges are realized, they would amount to just a 1 percent reduction in global emissions by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. Scientists say the number needs to be closer to a 50 percent reduction. </p>
        </div>

         <div class="mySlides">
          <h1>‘Strong and rapid’ cuts to methane needed</h1>
          <p>Methane, which is released into the atmosphere from abandoned coal mines, farming and oil and gas operations, has a global warming impact 84 times higher than CO2 over a 20-year period. It is responsible for almost a quarter of global warming. The authors state that a strong and rapid reduction in methane emissions would not only curb global warming but also improve air quality. </p>

        <div class="mySlides">
          <h1>We are closer to irreversible tipping points</h1>
          <p>"Abrupt responses and tipping points of the climate system, such as strongly increased Antarctic ice sheet melt and forest dieback, cannot be ruled out.” 

            The melting of Antarctic ice sheets could cause sea levels to rise more than a metre by 2100 and 15 metres by 2500. The 'substaintial increase in risks' was highlighted in recent analysis of parts of the Amzon which are now emitting more carbon than they absorb.</p>

        <p class="introFacts">Ours is the age of environmental breakdown brought about by the human destruction of our Earth.  The crisis we face today is due to a power crisis. Yet the mainstream media fixates on the role of individuals, but only a fundamental transformation of our current system can reverse the current trends. While individuals alone may not be able to make drastic emissions cuts, personal action can help pressure policymakers and businesses into a reformed system.  </p>

      <p class="facts">Using your voice as a consumer, a customer, a member of the electorate and an active citizen, will lead to changes on a much grander scale. </p>
      <p class="facts">Environmental destruction is a systematic problem of capitalism. The <a href= https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499691240 >CPD Carbon Majors 2017 Report </a> has made this very clear since 100 companies in the world have been responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions between 1880 to 2010.  We can tackle capitalism by changing our consumer behaviour and making companies feel the pressure. </p>
      <p class="facts">Other personal action we can partake in include: turning up to a <a href= https://www.instagram.com/fff_england/ > local climate strike </a>, taking part in a climate rally, lobbing the government for change or writing to your <a href= https://members.parliament.uk/FindYourMP > local MP</a>. </p>

        <p class="facts">Become aware of your carbon footprint using <a href= https://footprint.wwf.org.uk/#/ >WWF's carbon footprint calculator </a> and aim to reduce it. You can also offset your carbon emission by using apps like <a href=https://cogo.co> CoGo</a>.</p>
        <p class="facts">One way to do this is to shop second hand as the fast fashion industry accounts for around 10% of global emissions. You can visit your local charity shop or use apps like Depop or Vinted. Charity and second-hand shops have excellent product control procedures, which means the clothes within them is of the highest quality. </p>
        <p class="facts"> Changing your energy provider is an excellent way to influence your environmental impact on a national scale. Renewable Energy companies such as <a href= https://octopus.energy/ > Octopus Energy</a> are now providing cheap and sustainable energy. </p>
        <p class ="facts"> An estimated one-third of all the food produced in the world goes to waste so it is time to reduce your food waste. There are obvious ways to reduce your food waste such as preserving food and not over-purchasing. If you are already doing this, you could try a London based <a href= https://www.oddbox.co.uk/ > Oddbox </a> who sell 'ugly ' fruit and vegetables or <a href=https://toogoodtogo.org/en > Too Good To Go</a> who helps restaurants sell surplus food at a very discounted price.</p>
